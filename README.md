RhythmboxAlarm
=============

A simple little GTK/CLI program that allows the user to set 8 different alarms for various times. Each of these, when they go off, will start Rhythmbox playing if it is open. The GTK version is GRhythmboxAlarm - the CLI is RhythmboxAlarm.

To compile, do "make". To add a launcher to your Gnome 3 desktop, do "make launcher".

To start the daemon (necessary for the alarms to go off), do "./rboxalarm".
